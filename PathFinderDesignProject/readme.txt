This is my version of an A* pathfinding algorithm. The program also includes a GreedyBestFirst Search which does find a path, but fails to display which nodes it expanded along the way. I tried to animate the results using a Swing timer and a Runnable thread at the same time (which is why I think there were issues). In reality, however, the program, just displays the final state of the board. To run the program, you may edit the arrays (3rd and 4th parameters in PathFinder constructor) to change the start and end positions, respectively; make sure neither positions are a wall node (which I determined in the PathFinder class). The boolean at the end determines whether the search will be A* or GBF search - A* displays expansion correctly, but both find the path.
